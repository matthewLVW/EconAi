Stewie: Why do gamers actually choose to live in wormholes in EVE Online?  
Peter: Oh, it’s simple, Stewie. Wormholes are like the wild west but in space—no rules, no cops, just pure chaos and treasure.  
Stewie: So, they’re willingly moving into cosmic basements with monsters?  
Peter: Exactly! You get better loot, rare resources, and you never know who’s about to crash your party. It’s risky, but the rewards are big—like playing hide-and-seek for rent money.  
Stewie: But isn’t it terrifying not knowing what’s on the other side?  
Peter: That’s half the fun! You can’t even see who’s coming until they’re in your face. It’s like living in a haunted house, but your neighbors might be billionaires or pirates.  
Stewie: So, it’s high risk, high reward, and zero safety?  
Peter: Yup, and some folks just love the thrill. In EVE, wormholes are for the adrenaline junkies who want to break space just to see what falls out.  
Stewie: Remind me never to follow you into real estate, Peter.
