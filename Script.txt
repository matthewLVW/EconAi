Stewie: Why do payday loans mess people up so badly?

Peter: Because they’re like financial quicksand, Stewie. You borrow a little, but the fees suck you down faster than you can blink.

Stewie: So it’s not just a tiny loan ’til payday?

Peter: Nope. You pay huge interest, like, “buy a pizza today, owe them a pizza shop tomorrow” levels. Sometimes five hundred percent a year.

Stewie: Five hundred? That’s cartoon villain territory.

Peter: Exactly! They want you stuck, rolling it over, paying new fees every time. It’s like trying to climb out of a pit, but with extra shovels.

Stewie: So you’re saying these loans are basically money traps?

Peter: Yep, money traps with neon “Easy Cash” signs out front.

Stewie: I’ll stick to borrowing from Brian. At least he just charges sarcasm.
